dev tips I'm giving away a free web flow
Pro account every week during this whole
series that's a four hundred and $20
value stick around to the end find out
how that can be yours this is part three
of the web flow from scratch series and
I'm getting more used to finding my way
around the tool and I'm really having a
lot of fun there are some simple things
in my normal front-end programming kind
of like habits that I use a lot that I
can't use in web flow most of that being
like pseudo selectors and elements like
that but you know still I'm really
enjoying this adventure today we're
gonna create and style some reviews for
the podcast website that we've been
creating this whole time also you should
check out the podcast it's really good
all right for this part let's take a
look at what we're gonna do today we've
already done the video and about here we
have done the recent episodes last week
and this week we're going to be doing
support this show so it's like like
tutorial in that tutorials the
testimonials would get off of the iTunes
reviews that you guys who listened to
the podcast leave so this is pretty cool
and I'm gonna try to do this as fast as
I can so the first thing I'm gonna do is
just go to this thing what's it called
navigator grab this home section an
option drag it below this one so I'm
duplicating another home section but I'm
putting it below here and all I really
want from this home section is the
headline here and the first paragraph
and then so I don't need this video and
actually there is a donate button here
so let's see if we can just change the
background here of this thing I'll get
the exact color from this thing I use
Xcode excope is a tool that I have not
updated like 44 years but there's a
magnifying glass here and if I hover
over the screen it gives me the hex so
it's 6 7 DF a3 okay that's the green and
then
actually for this color here let's find
this one I learned that you can do you
can add a swatch and name it purple and
let's get rid of this loop again alright
let's get rid of one of these paragraphs
here and then what I want to do is
create some entries in the database
let's create a new what does it call
collection not a database a collection
call the new new collection called
reviews and reviews sure that sounds
good the field will be a name so that be
like the the name of the review so right
here says disturbingly amazing that'll
be that and then I need a plain not
plain text a oh yeah plain text does we
call it author and this one will be
called like date right
and another one for the rich text which
will be a review and that should be it
okay so let's create this we'll add some
new items here and I have already
created a text document with a few of
the items listed here so let's see here
we go this is the title of the first one
good so I have created am just the most
recent two reviews here and that should
be good there I'm gonna grab a new
section called dynamic list and pull it
in and for this section I'll say reviews
and the four column is good good good
now I need to pull in let's see a
headline let's get rid of this don't
need anymore
the headline here a heading and we'll
call that field the the name and then
we'll track in a new or another one
which would be like the date I'm just
gonna drag in a bunch of text objects at
this moment mmm date and then the name
of the person who's doing it that's the
author drag another text block in author
and the actual review for this one will
do a rich text I guess and for the rich
text we'll just say give us a review
cool okay so I think we have all the
content here there's some stars here
that we need to generate somehow let's
let's change this up so this says three
dot support the show cool and the alarm
can just chill like that we need to set
up a little bit of a structure here so
I'm gonna put a div block here and
inside of that div block I'm gonna put
the the heading is inside and also under
that the Asch tabs rather the name write
the name of the author so we have
heading author oh that's not inside
let's put it inside my yeah okay
so the div block rounds those two and we
need to get these all inside of another
div it's gonna be a little div div heavy
here but we need to do that so that we
can get so that we can get these things
like side to side right you see how
these are like kind of basically two
columns
put this block up above so two's one
into okay and then I'm gonna put them in
another one basically I'm gonna put them
in columns here where's that column
right there put it inside okay
so this one goes in oops goes in column
one there we go right inside and the
other one will get the date there's just
this one which would definitely don't
actually need it to be in a block since
it's going to be in the column too
so I get rid of this black yeah that's
all right except for like the big
borders around this thing this doesn't
need to be a each one though let's make
this an h4 okay and this one can be
text-align:left we'll call this will
call this review Tate
just make it text-align:left cool and
let's call this what is this gonna be
called it's the author right
so review author and the text color is
gonna be this have a gray I've never
done a gray
okay so let's choose a gray for the new
author now another thing left to do is
put another text block in here just I'll
label basically like a text element not
a block or does this have to be a embed
because remember how I did the last ones
up there these are done like this this
right here was done by doing it in bed
and because the word episode needed to
show up every time but this needs to
have the word by every time I'm trying
to make a swash of this grey color okay
now I can go and apply that same swash
to this this date okay if I like this
date is kind of floating that means I
need to get in here to this I'll make it
this this would be called the review
title and then once I review title I can
take I can just options option click no
shift-click I thought there was a way to
get rid of these option clip
all right so I'll put this one and have
a margin bottom like 10 20 cool dynamic
list is going to be called reviews
review list and it needs to have a
margin top of 50 and a margin bottom of
50 and now we're gonna go to the inner
one dynamic item and I call this review
item and I'll give it a bottom padding
of 50 and a bottom margin of 50 and that
actually means we don't have to have a
bottom padding on the one above it which
is a dime a mmm review list we don't
have to have that margin bottom there so
what we want to do is put a border
bottom on this one let's so let's do
border bottom just one pixel black how
about this gray too much gray
thirty percent there you go normally I
would just can turn this kind of Lion
off the bottom with it with a pseudo
class but can't really do pseudo classes
very well in web flow so I'm not really
sure how to handle that I don't know
let's do this I'll grab a text block and
put it in this block and it will say I
can review that thing okay and then I'll
let's call this a review late review
date label
yeah we're just make it make it in line
make this one in line too
review dates I'm gonna make this right
aligned text okay cool
now this one needs to have a little bit
of margin right let's say 10 pixels
margin right maybe less and the color
needs to be that same gray okay cool
that's good that looks good so this
appears to be it except for I need to
get some stars let's go to material
icons and download some both stars if we
can SPG no notice we do own a pink okay
so I have this ping star here I can drag
to my assets drag the two x star in the
assets and let me pull these out and put
it right there so I want this size of it
to be there we go that's good and that's
cool so let's make a tag for it star
review - star display that's in line
black oh one thing I'm gonna do is take
the opacity down down to 30 that's fine
let's move this out with a little bit
margin 2030
nope 20 okay now here it's becoming a
problem hmm what does this look like
when we get down this doesn't look too
bad but it's like obviously like here
and here this is like pretty pretty bad
and pretty bad okay well in this setting
let's just shift all this text to the
left again that looks better
well I want to keep these stars together
so I'll put these in a what's it called
a in the dip walk
a star star star oh we can't do him at a
time I can't do as a group I guess put
him in there one at a time
you know I think that's fine
well I'm not gonna put them over to the
side I mean I could do it by using
floats and things what's really having
giving me a problem as this column's
that I tried to do not too happy with
the column see because this column I
want to do a lot further away I should
have just floated bees instead well
that's okay it's not too bad that's it
for the that's it for the support this
show section what we're going to do next
is look at the way to put like links to
images and kind of a gallery here on the
