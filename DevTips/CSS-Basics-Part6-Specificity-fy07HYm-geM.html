Nielson this is deaf tips and you are
simply a better class of person just for
watching this this is the sixth video in
a series I call CSS basics today we're
talking about specificity which is a
concept fundamental to being a good web
developer a few weeks ago we had my
friend Louis in the garage to talk about
cascading and aside from being
informational I thought it was hilarious
to have him on the show in that episode
we mentioned that the cascading nature
of CSS means that it is read in a
specific order namely top to bottom if
there are two equals CSS rules the
browser will apply the one it reads last
for example here we have two CSS
declarations the first one says P is
colored red and the second one says P is
colored blue the browser reads top to
bottom so in this example your
paragraphs will be blue every time this
is a result of the Cascade our little
brother just had a baby just now like
while I'm recording he sends me a
picture of this thing check it out he
named it Radin after the mortal kombat
guy it's pretty cool but what if we want
that paragraph to be red and for some
reason we can't remove that blue style I
don't know man maybe there's like a
biker gang who has your mom captive and
they're like you better not remove that
style or else we're gonna take all your
your mom's cookies and eat I mean you'll
never have any more cookies why is the
Becker gang so interested in your mom's
cookies I don't know what's with all
these questions come on let's get those
cookies all we have to do is add another
tag name onto that first selector like
this article P color red so what the
heck just happened well for one thing we
just saved your mom's life not to
mention our cookies another thing that
just happened is specificity the first
rule was more specific and so even if
there was a matching style later on down
the stylesheet it was that first rule
that was applied cuz there's more
specific because it's more specific
because there's more specific cuz it's
more specific because it's more specific
this is worse
stick by the way sorry if this video
comes off a little weird I'm on like the
four hours of sleep in the last 48 and
that's when things get awesome but also
a little weird that's when I'm like high
energy high creativity and then I crash
for two days it's going to be so freakin
great there are some rules happening
here and it's a little bit of math but
not too much so here we go a selector
that names one tag is worth one point a
selector that names two tags is worth
two points
the selector with the most points wins
every time
despite the Cascade okay let's do
another example back here we said the
paragraphs inside the article element
will be read and that's true the
selector has two tags in it but let me
throw a monkey wrench in your happy
little life let me break your worldview
here I'm writing another style selector
here that has two parts to it as well
just like the other one can you guess
what happened do you think that the
selector with two parts that is the last
to be read will be the one that's
implemented wrong haha pay attention you
silly pants let's look at this mark
aprender and who is your face chicken
you're not Squire I'd neglected to tell
you purposefully that a class selector
is worth 10 points
so we have two points one point and 10
plus 1 points which is the highest
number of points 11 yes good that makes
sense right well wrong because I lied to
you haha but I did it because I love you
the selector with a class in it is not
worth 11 points it's worth 10-1
points does it make sense that's okay
let's talk about it a tag with one
selector is not really worth one point
it's worth one point in that first space
a selector with two tags is not worth
two points it's worth two points in that
first space a class in the selector is
not worth 10 points it's worth one point
in the space that looks like the tens
column if you can remember place values
back in third grade math so not ten
points
one point in the second column counting
right-to-left like numbers to complicate
the delicate and fragile world of CSS
specificity we also have to deal with ID
selectors which add one point to the
hundredths column and even then inline
styles which add one point to the
thousands column isn't this awesome
isn't this awesome now I want to draw
your attention to the difference between
the idea of class main P being worth 11
points and being worth 1-1 points and to
help me I want to introduce you to
something called a specificity
calculator here at this specificity
calculator I can just enter in the
selectors and it will give me the output
of how specific these selectors are so
in the bottom here I'm going to enter a
class name of main and we can see that
main gives us 0 0 1 0 that's how
specific main is and I want to try to
beat that
by adding a whole bunch of classes so
I'm going to add one too I was going to
add 11 a z' in this top column ok and so
the so here we have 0 0 0 11 and I'm
going to press this button that will
order it by specificity AHA 0 0 0 11 is
not more specific than 0 0 1 0 which is
why every time your text is orange ok I
hope that I have opened your mind and
you now have a technical grasp on how
this works but I want to show you a
small real-world example of how all
these principles come into play when
you're coding CSS I have some basic
Styles on this website on my right and
here I want to to show you how I can be
specific with how I style my links ok I
want all of the anchor tags to be color
red ok and then
I want all of the anchors in the aside
to be white color white with the
background color of a grey here and then
I'll just decorate it so some padding
get rid of that underlying and the
radius border radius there okay
and then I have an anchor on the page
which is a by now anchor link and I want
to make it stand out a little bit so I
put a class name of primary on it and so
I want to call that primary to be color
white and then the background is a bit a
bit darker here we are just like that we
use specificity and now we are awesome
and great developers and very special
people
CSS specificity is something that you
need to understand if you want to take
this seriously so keep it in mind as you
code them internets and watch out for
partners are trying to steal your boys
cookies
thanks for watching guys I really
appreciate your support in the next
video we're going to look at all the
fancy things you can do with css3 or at
least some of the fancy things because
there's a lot you learned something from
this video please share it on Facebook
or Twitter or whatever the crap you kids
are using now will be coming to a close
of our CSS basics series in the near
future and I'll be looking to you guys
for ideas of what kind of videos you
want in the future what you want to
learn about so if you have any specific
questions you can leave them in the
comments down below and we'll do that
and if you have not yet please subscribe
