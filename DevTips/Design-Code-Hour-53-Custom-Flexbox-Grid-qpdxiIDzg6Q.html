YouTube but you figured that out already
because you're clever and you've been
watching about five hours of them so far
this is the third part of the fifth hour
in a video series I call design and code
my personal website in 12 hours I could
hope by now you can tell them being a
little loose with the whole 12 hour
thing ah today we're making a custom
responsive grid using flexbox we're not
going to be using an existing solution
like bootstrap or foundation and why is
that you may ask because we're cool
all righty you guys pumped I'm so pumped
I think we can get this grid situated
tonight I think I can do it tonight I am
so excited but we just did the header
and the mobile version of the navigation
and now I need to make a responsive grid
that's going to be specific to this
design that I built let's review the
grid you'll notice here I have two
columns it's really simple grid two
columns
300 pixels each and 10 pixels padding or
margin on the right and the left so
there's 20 pixel gutter in the center
here and there's going to be 10 pixels
on the margin on each of the sides here
now that's a very specific number number
320 is a is a number that you'll see on
mobile devices as being the width of
most mobile devices I'm thinking
specifically for Apple devices because I
have an apple phone and you just kind of
design sometimes sometimes you end up
designing for what you got because
because you don't want your own fun to
look at them anyway so what the grid is
like we have two columns at 320 pixels
each and then we have this side over
here of 135 pixels okay so let's look at
how these columns work sometimes these
columns are both together centered and
we have like this right column here and
a column of content here and they're
centered together and they look fine
here is another instance of them being
centered this time this one has elements
that are going over off to
other one but that's that's still that
it'll be contained in here and just like
absolutely positioned and they just
happen to be sitting above but these are
two columns centered together again so
it's basically the same as the one above
it the one on top here is two columns
but one is growing out into the left
which is which is still fine I mean
that's two columns centered right still
so for the first three you know two
column Center this one's a little
different because look this is the
column here as as per the design but the
actual content is right here so this one
is not centered this column is floating
in the middle of half of the visible
space the other half of the visible
space is 100% taken up by these boxes so
this is a very very different situation
it will have to take account for that
possibility when we develop our grid now
this next one also is unique it's like
the the columns right here
but the design is floating within that
fifty percent area as well even though
the fifty percent is not taking up this
whole space the design itself it they're
you know they're floating in inside of
this space inside of their 320 pixels so
the grid item is just floating around
and the same for these ones these are
not centered or rather these are not
together centered they're individually
centered in their half of a column and
this one is basically a full-width right
this subscribe box goes all the way
across the two columns and so we'll have
to figure out how that's going to break
down when it goes into a mobile view and
then similar to the podcast section and
then this one doesn't even obey any
grids so we have to make a flexible
enough grid system to accommodate all of
these situations that's going to be a
lot of fun so let's get started I'm
going to go into the index.html file
here and we had this spacer but I'm just
going to create a new file in the Jade
files and I'll call it columns and this
is a temporary file I don't think that
it'll be a part of the eventual layout
but I'm using this as Oh
to test my theory of how these columns
will work out right so there's my
columns file and I go into index.html
and I'm going to create and include to
include these columns am and perception
I'm include these columns this columns
file into my layout so that I can have
them rendered this is called column or
columns columns HTML ok Coolio
now check check look check a look take a
look at this these columns are showing
up in the home sections so the home
sections are the places where these you
know these sections and the columns that
we just looked at are going to show up
right currently in that home section
there's a div with a 2,000 pixel height
and I'll just leave it there that
doesn't matter but I'll put that below
the columns actually put this columns
above that thing so we can mess with it
okay cool cool cool cool
so in our columns a new document here
we're going to simulate what it's like
to be creating these sections and so
we're going to use the section HTML
element and you can class these things
like so the first one is going to be
about and inside the about I want to
have two columns right so column - one
and another column - one inside column -
one will have a paragraph you know it
doesn't doesn't matter right now
and also we got I should just have here
in the design to two paragraphs
well well well looky loo looky loo okay
so why is this why are these paragraphs
pushing this sidebar all the way back
over here it's because they are set to
display flex these two columns in in the
index right here so home wrap and oh
sorry no header the header element and
the home sections are set to display
flex and there are flexing out without
being told what should take priority
what should flex what should not flex so
let's go back into the home sass and say
home wrap display flex and I'll identify
this element right here home sections
class home sections and I'll say flex
what that means it will be the one to
grow and shrink and since we have it
defined width of 135 on the the sidebar
which is actually the header it will
remain firm and when we make this wider
the home sections will be the growing
and shrinking yeah it looks good so the
structure of our columns here is in this
section we have two columns column one
column two and then each of these is the
paragraph so basically there's a column
wrapping each of these paragraphs I need
to get these columns sort it out and get
them set up so let's come down here to a
call - what I want your max width to be
300 pixels and your margin is going to
be 0 on the top and bottom and 10 on the
left and right cool
you know what I'm thinking right now I'm
thinking that I don't want I don't want
the columns to be directly in this
section because I want to use flex but
okay so the reason I don't want them in
this section is that I don't want a
section I don't want a section as an
HTML element to dictate the style of
what what its containers are right I
want that to be dictated by a purposeful
class so I'll wrap these two columns in
a class and it did with a class of oh
let's say flex whereas X there you go
flex now we'll go into here and we'll
say home sections and flex is display
flex and flex Direction row rows rows
cool and then justify content
Center all right now our two columns are
looking good and but I can put like
styles on the sections that would be not
pertaining to the columns themselves
because like I don't want to restrict
the sections to being column parents
every time maybe I want some content
outside of the Flex parent or maybe I
want to kind of types of columns in the
same section right so I'm being a little
bit like forward thinking about this and
I want the Flex element here to be the
distributor of the Flex kind of
properties I don't think I'm explaining
that very well but you'll see what I
mean so but we can say section right
here and I just want to put some padding
on it like 50 50 pixels of padding yeah
that's fine oh but left and right zero
okay so let me show you with this
columns we'll put a background of pink
now we can see how these columns are
working that when I get bigger these
columns stay centered and that's good
that's exactly what we wanted but we
need to put what happens when these
columns get too small I don't want it in
a mobile setting these columns still be
there so remember the max width of the
columns is going to be 640 pixels
because 320 times 2 is 640 so we'll see
@media max width
is equal to 640 pixels and then in there
I'll take those columns again oh it's
not the columns themselves it's the it's
the Flex guy so it's going to be home
sections flex almost hi display:block
all right so when this gets below 640
right now it's at 670 and this way block
yay but we need to take those columns
right here
call - one and say it's max width is OTO
is that a property of maximum no 100%
and that is exactly what we wanted so
let's show that again here's the two
columns our navigation breaks at at 640
plus 135 which is 775 and that happens
right there we still have our two
columns until you get to 640 and they
break right there
and we have two columns vertically
stacked so this is completely responsive
that's exactly how we wanted it to act
let's take care of those other use cases
so those are the two centered ones like
that and like that
what about what about what about these
floating ones how will we do that
all on to what we have here column chain
flex let's say Flex Center
for that one and we'll break this guy
off and say flex - - Center and then
let's make another class that says a
flex - desk space around and justify
content space around now we need to if
we have two more columns in a different
section oh you guys are dented oh there
we go okay so now I have a different
section and this one's going to be
YouTube or something we want space
around the browser refreshes ooh what do
we have here I don't think I did it
right did I not put it in the HTML
justify there we go that's what we
wanted okay so you see how these things
kind of float a little bit differently
so in situations like these this vine
here and this dribble and behance these
ones will flow a little differently they
won't be locked together because they're
interdependent right they're not into
they're not independent of each other
they still rely on each other for
context but they're not dependent on
each other for structure right like
these ones are or like you know like
these ones are these ones all right
they're interdependent so we want them
to be able to float on their own but yes
come together and then when the time
comes
OOP right there yeah okay okay now
there's another thing I want to think
about where these these columns here
some of them will have these call to
actions and when they're collapsed every
time I want that call to action to be on
the bottom right so what we're doing
here is we're removing flex so the
bottom will be the second one in the Dom
in this case the column one the second
column will be on the bottom so this
one's going to have this
ta let's say has CTA and that's fine but
when it's flexed sometimes I need that
has CTA to be on the left right I need
to be ordered a little bit differently
and so how I'm going to do that is let's
say if this one has a CTA on it and one
has CTA I don't want to focus on the
fact that it has a CT it's just going to
be the one we want to say order first I
guess that would be fine so here we go
to flex order first is going to be order
negative negative one okay now so it
happened the the CTA here is on the left
and that's kind of what we want for this
style and then when we when we shrink
our browser down it will be on the
bottom because the order property is
dependent on the display flex property
since we're removing that when we get
into mobile dimensions the order is no
longer validation valid CSS and it's
ignored so it will go to the bottom and
that's how we get those CTA is on the
left from time to time we'll put a class
of order - first on it I like it now we
have another style as well where we have
kind of like down here full width it's
two columns so let's make a class in the
column section called call - - now this
max width is going to be 300 plus 300 so
it's 600 plus the 20 pixels in the
middle so 620
now it's accommodating for the margins
in the middle but it's not accommodating
for the margins on the right in the left
so we need to add those similar to be
how we did in that column - one column
the margin:0 10px Ilan the right in the
left that's that's in put a background
on it so we can see it and we'll call
this one honeydew
if we go into our columns Jade let's
grab another section
all right now this is this they don't
need that second column because we're
just doing a one column thing that will
span both columns so column two
flex-space around will do okay um yeah
that worked here's one column that sits
in the middle and we need to put it Flex
Center and you put Flex Center to get
that floating in the center once we use
that class cool so the column of classes
here these will dictate just basically
the dimensions of the columns and then
the Flex classes here
will affect how those columns are
displayed and in what way now there's
another type of column that I want which
is which is like this this one is going
to be really interesting this one's
going to be it's not limited to 320
pixels right it's basically going to
ignore that convention so I want to have
I'll just call it a call - 50 because
it's 50% of the width even though it's
not 50 columns but you with me you get
me so I'll say width is 50% yeah that's
good so we'll make another another
section here below this one
okay and I'll say column after the
second one column 50 nut space around
let me see this car miss is right let's
say a back ground yellow it's 50% wide
but it's not touching the edges like I
wanted it's not doing what I wanted
because it's spaced around
so what I need to do okay here's what I
need to do on that one I think that I
can make this work with just the
existing classes so spacer around
becomes Center and column one actually
gets inside of column 50 so so there's
going to be two column 50s here they're
going to be centered and then column 50
gets a flex and flex Center
oh if flex I'd write as well now hoping
what will happen here and we have a flex
50 on flex 50 so these two that works
but I have a flex Center here and this
is not centered mm-hmm flex Center flex
oh okay two dashes Save and center okay
that's that's what I wanted okay so
there's two elements here they're both
yellow so it looks like one big spanning
element let me show you here's one and
here's the other they're both 50% wide
which means they're nope they're not
going to be constrained by the same 320
I'll have pixels that the other columns
are and when I then and then this one
actually has inside of it another column
- one which is constrained and it's
centered inside of that column so we
have like a 50% one and then a 50% one
with a small in floating inside it when
I bring it down here it will it will
break
but that's good that's good but I
because it needs to be not flex it but
it needs to be full with again so in
home under this column say call call -
50 that's a class with is auto 3r I
think that's all of the use cases right
so we have column floating columns one
big centered column and then like 50
percent with it collapses and stuff like
that I think that's just about
everything all right I'm very happy so
with what we've done now is we've built
a a grid custom flexible grid responsive
grid just for this design and because we
know exactly what our design is going to
be we know exactly what I want
our grid can be like tailored exactly to
what we need so yeah looking pretty good
oh yeah buddy we're in a great place for
next week's video where we lay out the
hero section and the YouTube section
this grid is awesome
