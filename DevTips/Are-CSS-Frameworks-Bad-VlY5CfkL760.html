ah today I want to spend a few minutes
answering a question this question was
left on a recent video we did about CSS
frameworks I love this question so I
wanted to share it with you so here is
the question I've been a software
recruiter for over 20 years during that
time I've seen a lot of technology come
down the pipeline and more than my share
of trends that said one of the trends
that I've seen is the heavy reliance on
frameworks and tool sets by new
developers this has become increasingly
prevalent in the past five years
for instance rarely do I not come across
a junior front-end developer three years
or less experienced in my book claiming
to be a quote expert at JavaScript yet
has confused it with jQuery or believes
that they are one in the same I say this
because when I send out code exercises
specifically asking for a JavaScript
solution they send it back using jQuery
then I end up explaining the difference
using a few examples of my own and they
think that I don't know what I'm talking
about
Lo and the div soup today is scary
for instance when I send out HTML and
CSS exercises I frequently get the HTML
back using some sort of grid system
buried in a sea of div tags when I
specifically asked for HTML 5 using
current semantic markup I guess my
question is do you see a hazard for
developers getting too hooked on tools
that offer a lot of shortcuts and reduce
development time is there a danger in
losing the fundamentals not learning
them at all or even properly also at
what point in a developer's career would
you say is the right time to pick up a
development tool for example bootstrap
or jQuery again great show I look
forward to many more videos also I know
that I may have hit a few hot buttons
for some readers so please keep the
comments civil isn't that a fantastic
question its phrase and framed perfectly
thank you so much for asking it that
comes from Callebaut co1 now I'll take a
crack at giving my perspective on it now
keep in mind that even though I have a
youtube show I'm still an idiot okay so
give me a little bit of slack in
answering this now I have never used a
framework in one of my personal projects
in the past I've considered them very
hack I think this is because when I
learned to code front ends it was back
in the day when the idea of a Semantic
Web was was a big deal right it was a
big deal in the evolution of the
industry and even in the technology
itself the very idea of the thing which
you so eloquently identified as div soup
has always been a very repulsive thing
to me that is until recently very
recently actually I may have mentioned
on this show that I'm actually not a
developer I am a professional designer
having said that I do tend to straddle
the disciplines very evenly and in fact
I may even lean heavily on the front end
of things but being the only designer in
a sea of very talented software
engineers in my office I took it upon
myself some time last year and created
what has become known as the pattern
library in the office the idea
originally was to create a set of sass
mix-ins that were super cool and super
smart and you could use them to create a
beautifully marked up and semantic Dom
and also to provide a number of useful
tools to the engineers when they were
writing their own sass I thought it was
amazing and wonderful but the engineers
they ignored it why because they didn't
necessarily care about a semantically
marked up page it's a good thing to have
and they respect it and they understand
it but that's not the goal so what is
the goal speed speed speed speed as much
as me saying this would make me cringe
about six months ago I understand now
that building your interface quickly is
more important than making sure that
your class name describes your content
when you stop and think about the three
building blocks of a rendered webpage
right HTML CSS
in JavaScript it becomes obvious why
this div soup method is the fastest way
to go the HTML part is the most
tweakable and the most commonly changed
out component in the whole group whole
javascript libraries are being created
now not only to talk to servers and
gather interpret data and manipulate the
Dom in little spaces but really to
render whole entire webpages angular
backbone ember all of these abstract the
markup to JavaScript modules to be
inserted in the page as needed now if
I'm thinking like an engineer and I'm
used to chopping up webpages and
spitting them out in different ways then
changing a simple class name to get a
visual effect is a natural extension of
that paradigm if you made an engineer
that's not great at hands-on CSS stuff
that's because you don't use JavaScript
to manipulate style sheets use
JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and you
know add inline Styles or a new class so
if the name of the game is speed and
you'll already have a set of common
conventions or a framework of ideas that
will quickly manipulate the Dom to
create a visual experience that's
exactly what's going to what you're
going to use and this is why a new
front-end framework pops up literally
every other day now in my pattern
library at work I finally understood
that engineers really want to rapidly
prototype ideas not fuss with semantics
indeed it's been said that the two most
difficult parts of computer programming
are number 1 cache invalidation and
number 2 naming things naming things one
of the hardest things about computer
programming so that's what I did with my
library I output all these very smart
mix ins into common classes I divided
the classes into an atomic structure and
it worked very very hard to document
everything basically I tried to make it
as fast as I can not performance but
usability usability for engineers to use
now that doesn't mean that the CSS
output is not optimized and it doesn't
mean that the markup is not cement
but the focus is no longer on those
things the focus is on speed now the
adoption of my patterns has been a lot
greater since then and because it's
actually faster the engineers can
prototype can prototype ideas much
faster now on this channel on dev tips
we have this series where we're looking
at these different grid frameworks and
this is mostly the first time that I've
ever used them and I've been pleasantly
surprised on how well they make good on
their promise to build prototypes faster
but therein lies the rub right their
promise is clear but often it's confused
by people looking for a shortcut if you
consider the names of these frameworks
bootstrap foundation we can see the
intention of the authors these are
intended to be tools on top of which
things are built their danger though is
that they can be too useful right they
can be a crutch in as much as it can be
easy to think that being proficient with
these frameworks is the same thing as
understanding how they work so to answer
your question yes I do think that it's
unwise to use tools that you don't fully
understand furthermore I think that it
can be dangerous to make that practice a
habit is this mustache throwing you off
because I'm serious when I teach a new
concept here on dev tips I really do try
my best to start at zero when we did the
HTML basics series we started with a
history lesson the same thing with the
CSS basics series when we did the start
to finish series we spent the entire
first episode talking about user
personas and having empathy even the
second video was about wire framing and
and design and we didn't even touch code
until episode 4 and we never used a
framework so to answer your second
question I don't think that there's a
wrong or a right time to pick up
frameworks but I do think that it is
always a bad
to use a framework if you don't
understand how and why it works can you
open the files you just downloaded and
read them have you I think that they can
be a great learning tool most of them
are put together by amazingly smart and
talented people with real-world
experience picking up a new framework
and trying to understand it as much as
learn how to use it will take you very
far I think the video that this question
was asked on is a part of the bootstrap
series
I also recently made the foundation part
of this series and learning the
differences between them and their
different approaches has been
enlightening after using a lot of them
you then have the experience to talk
about what you like most out of all of
them it's kind of like dating right you
have to get around figure out what you
like don't settle down with the first
framework you meet that's crazy this
video has just been a lot of me talking
and I'm sorry about that we'll do some
codes next week I promise but here's a
summary of what I'm talking about
I don't think frameworks are going away
but they will get better I don't think
that they've arrived yet
I would advise people to learn
fundamentals first fundamentals are
called so for a reason they are the
foundation of your knowledge base as a
web developer they are the foundation on
which you build everything else if you
have weak fundamentals you have built a
weak house and it will fall over when
the first gust of wind comes number
three a good way to tell if your
fundamentals are good enough to be even
considering using frameworks is to look
at the frameworks open them up look at
the source code can you read it can you
understand it do you understand why the
author's made the decisions that they
did what were they going for often you
can find commented versions of these
frameworks and you will learn a butt ton
by reading that crap it is awesome and
last I think it's a great idea to try a
new framework every new project that you
do there are plenty of frameworks in the
sea right go out there and meet some new
ones it's not you
it's me I was holding you back you're
going places right hey hey I love you I
mean I hope this answer was satisfactory
you're too good for me so that's it for
me I'm done talking let me ask you in
the comments below dev tips question of
the week there's a few of them number
one do you think that it's a hazard for
developers to get too hooked on
frameworks that promise reduced
development time is there a danger in
losing the fundamentals not learning
them at all or even properly I would
love to know your opinions leave your
answers in the comments below and until
next time keep on hacky stupid
