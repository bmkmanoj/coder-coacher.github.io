and today we're going to be looking at
my top 5 features in github 'z atom code
editor ah about a month ago I published
a video called my code editor atom setup
and packages and you guys really enjoyed
that video so much so that I figured
we'd return to the topic today if you
haven't seen that video it will go over
where to go download it and how to set
it up to get you going so features there
are a lot of kind of headline features
in atom that really give it a lot of its
uniqueness and strength these are not a
part of my top 5 list but you should
definitely be aware of them so these are
kind of like the honorable mentions of
the video atom package library the
extension library in atom is pretty
substantial there's a great community
around this editor Adam calls these
extensions packages and it has a really
great package manager' found in the
settings screen from there you can
search the web for new packages remove
the ones that you've previously
installed or mess with the individual
package settings generally if the
package exists for sublime Adam has it
to get a where Adam is get aware and
this is great when you create a new file
it's colored green in the sidebar when
the file has been edited it's orange
right here at the bottom you get a quick
report of what get branch you're on and
how many new or deleted lines and how
far ahead or behind you are of the
remote branch it's pretty sweet
command palette the command palette is
accessible by the keys command shift P
this nifty menu here is pretty powerful
you can fire any command that Adam can
do from this menu and that even includes
features added by packages that you
install alright and now for my top 5
list these are the things that I love
about this editor they may not be
game-changing features but the things
that whenever I use them they definitely
make me smile the first feature is
multi-line cursors when I did a review
of coda which is another code editor I
mentioned that it had multi-line edit
this is one step ahead buts super easy
to use and really powerful in this
example I have a ul with a bunch of list
items I'm just going to click on the end
of each of these list items here while
I'm holding the command key and each
time I click I'm inserting a new cursor
now notice that unlike
Khoda they're not all in the same column
it's just wherever I insert a cursor so
I can go arrow back and forward and they
all move independently of each other but
they're all obeying the same commands
now you might think oh this is not going
to be useful because they're all crazy
like well you can use modifier keys like
options to line them up like this now
let's say I want to go back and wrap
each of each of these list items in an
anchor tag and you might be thinking
well they're not all in the same column
how is this going to work if I start
typing here it's like all you know weird
if you use the modifier keys with the
arrow keys they're actually pretty
powerful for example command an arrow
goes to the end of the line or the
beginning of the line and now they're
all lined up straight I can hold option
and jump to the beginning or the end of
words so I'll just jump to the beginning
of the words that are all needed like
this so anyway Anchor ref equals you
know that's my anchor tag and then a
hold option and press right arrow key
and jump to the end of the words and
then end my anchor tag it's pretty easy
like that in this way the multi-line
cursor is super powerful there's a lot
of uses for it the next feature is the
file finder now in a big project it can
be super annoying to have to click
through each of these these folders to
find the file that you want you can just
hit command T and let's say we wanted
the file but had to do with colors I
don't remember exactly what its name was
but colors we have colors scss color
sass and of columns so it's a fuzzy
finder so it found Co L or o L here this
is one we wanted right here colors dot
sass and then we can just go find the
thing that we're looking for it's really
fast and the fuzziness of the search
works really well number three on the
list is Adams style sheet this thing
exists for no other reason than to just
make Adam hackable and make me happy
you can open atom style sheet at any
time by going to the atom menu at the
top here and then choosing open your
style sheet now it's super hackable you
can do a whole lot of things I'm just
going to show you a really weird example
tree view is
a is a selector and then I'm going to
change the background to you know pink
and there you are you can do anything
you can change the heaviness of the
guidelines you can change like the font
size of the sidebar you can like what's
the line height what are the icons like
anything that you can you can do
anything because this whole this whole
editor I just press command option I you
can see that this whole interface here
is selectable and kind of hackable so
for example I don't know let's just take
this one here
we'll grab this one tree view name also
font size 3m you see I mean that's I
don't know why anybody would want to do
that but you can do whatever you want
the next feature is something that I
mentioned how to turn it on in the last
settings video but this is seriously for
me I couldn't leave it out of this list
it's my number one feature even though
it's number four in this list it's it's
my favorite thing in the world and that
is that atom can scroll past the end of
a document so for example here I have 91
lines in this document but I can keep on
scrolling and move and move this up and
I just I just love that because I used
to do this he's go to da da da and
that's how I would get this all this
content up but I don't need to have all
these extra lines anymore because I can
just scroll past the end so in the
settings is right here scroll past the
end if I turn that off then I'm sad now
I can't scroll up anymore but I turned
it on watch this turn it on now I'm
happy I can scroll past the end see
that's how it works
mmmmmm is really a life changer is it
just like increases your quality of life
the last feature on my list is super
nerdy we talked a little bit about it in
the last series called github for noobs
but Adam can install command-line shell
commands and how to do that is go to
Adam and then click install shell
commands and there that's done now when
you're working in your terminal if you
guys you know like terminal awesome let
me close this Adam here you're working
your terminal and you can just right
Adam and it will open a blink Adam
editor now if you want it to be targeted
to the the directory that you're working
in you write space dot and then when you
hit enter it will open up the directory
that you're working in now this can work
in a lot of ways you can open up even
specific directories so for example dot
assets dot CSS if I want to get into
just my CSS folders right here see it
opened up just the CSS you can open up
let's say Adam dot slash um the asterisk
and asterisk is a wild-card character so
that means anything that's in the root
will just open that up and that will
open up the files themselves that are in
the root alright so everything that can
be opened up in its own little page here
gets opened up so there's a lot of
useful ways you can open out and
straight from the terminal but you can
also do other interesting things and for
a list of all those go to Adam /h and it
will give you a help menu you just make
this bigger it will give you a help menu
of all the things that you that you can
do so for example you can you know
create a log file from all of the
outputs that you're doing put it in
safety mode or test versions things like
that so this can be very very handy for
people who use the command line pretty
often
today's dev tips question of the week is
what is your favorite Adam package leave
a comment down below and I'll make a
video about the most popular packages
that you guys mentioned now be sure to
read through the other comments first
because if you see the package already
mentioned in another comment just upvote
that comment the package that you know
top-voted will win over the package that
has the most individual comments if that
makes sense
it's not about number of times that's
mentioned it's about how many votes it
gets so go and thumb up your favorite
one to make sure your package wins and
then you should visit patreon.com slash

dev tipsters there who all decided to
pledge a few dollars of their choosing
to the show they get extra perks like
seeing the videos early and extra videos

monthly hangouts that we do it's a fun
time come join us
thank you for watching and keep on
