okay so little history lesson it was
three years ago when I came to this con
hear him it was on this way it was at
this spot so there were those kids are
where I register the URL dev tips for
designers and started the YouTube
channel that we all know and love today
is def tips so what we're going to do
today is going to walk around the con
I'm going to take a few questions we're
going to draw ourselves
alright this first question comes from
10 honor 6 cloud up in here ok and 10 on
our success I know HTML and CSS and I
know I can do the things the clients
need but it doesn't help that I can't
design I'm learning it but i feel kind
of stuck I want to make a copy of
another website but i'll do the code
just so people can see that i can do the
work but the problem would be that
somebody would think that I didn't code
it that i just copied it what should I
do that's a really great question i
would consider pairing with another
designer you can do the code and he can
do the design and you have two things in
your portfolio and instead of just the
one I think this is a win-win good luck
all right this next question comes from
Adrian Fernandez Adrian says this is
jiggling a lot Adrian says if I have the
skills and the desire to build a website
business but I have no nothing in my
portfolio yet I haven't done any work
how can I attract new interest in my
work if I have nowhere to show this was
interesting and the answer is kind of
simple but maybe not obvious the answer
is that you should make some work to
show and it doesn't have to be for
another client it can be for yourself or
people you know you can even go to a
non-profit and do some work pro bono the
thing is you just want to fill your
portfolio with some work that you want
to do you don't I mean you don't want to
feel your portfolio with work that you
don't want to be stuck doing later do
work that you like and if you feel your
portfolio with work that you like other
people will see that and hire you to do
that same work the work that you like
okay this question comes from Nathan
Schwartz Nathan says I know I'm good at
what I do and I know that I can provide
clients with the things that they need
and then they desire however they're
just not accepting me I send message
after message and I never get any
replies after the third message waiting
about a week or so for response I just
give up and I think to myself why did i
even dream about being a web designer in
the first place Thank You Nathan great
question man I think this is a problem
that a lot of people deal with when
they're first starting right because
they don't have clients referring other
clients or they don't have this kind of
like snowball effect of people
word-of-mouth referrals and things like
that what of mouth referrals are the
best referrals but if you don't have any
experience or have any current clients
it's going to be very hard to do but
here again is another issue that people
don't really buy the work they do but
not to the degree that you might expect
people by stories people by you okay
there is a podcast that we did in my
podcast with with Carlos late nights
with trav and lows and we talked about
how everybody needs to be a salesperson
you're a designer if you're a developer
you still need to understand how to sell
because the only way that your product
is going to get accepted by other people
is if you tell the story correctly okay
now for some tactical suggestions
instead of hounding your prospect to get
a job say please please please pay me to
do things for you you could just do
things for them and say look what I did
for you who do you think that you know
would benefit from something like this
now all of a sudden you had you have
done work for somebody and you have the
opportunity to source them for a
referral you can try this with small
businesses in your area with people that
you know that are trying to start new
ideas an online store whatever you could
do this with with a non-profit give them
work pro bono and then ask them if they
know anybody who needs additional work
and then you can get that snowball
rolling word of mouth and referrals are
always going to be the best source
of of work people by stories they buy
you not the work in Dubai the work but
it's mostly
it's been really it's really great
highlights though number one is meaning
cool people like guy I'm so over the
moon and excited to meet guy guy is a
patron on patreon com / depa this is
