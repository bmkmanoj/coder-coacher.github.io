McKenzie child and this is episode 2 out
of 5 in the Ruby on Rails from the
ground up series last week we talked
about what Ruby on Rails is in the
history behind it and in this episode we
are going to go step-by-step through the
process of getting your development
environment set up with everything you
need to get going
with Ruby on Rails so let's jump in ah
alright let's dive in and get our
development environment set up so just
so you guys know I am working from a
fresh install of OS X El Capitan Version
10.9 so I am starting from scratch here
and I'm going to go step by step on how
to set up your rails development
environment the following is specific
towards Mac if you're on Windows or
Ubuntu it's a little bit different so I
want to recommend a few resources to you
to get set up first would be go rails
comm go rails has these fantastic and
detailed guides on how to get set up for
various versions of Ubuntu as well as
Mac OS X so I would definitely recommend
checking those out and the next would be
install rails comm it's a simple
step-by-step guide based on your
operating system because it's slightly
different between the various operating
system and then if you click Windows for
example it goes step by step through the
process of getting set up based on your
operating system so it does tell you to
visit rails installer comm which is the
next resource I want to recommend rails
installer is a project by Engine Yard
and basically all you have to do
download a package and it sets up pretty
much everything for you it's pretty
fantastic so if you are on a Mac stick
with me and we will go step-by-step
through the process of getting your
rails environment set up so first let me
close these so we're going to be using
three different programs to code in this
series the first is Chrome which I have
already downloaded here
that's just my preferred browser of
choice you can either use a crow
Safari or Firefox but please for the
sake of web developers everywhere just
don't ever ever use Internet Explorer
all right so I term 2 is a terminal
emulator for Mac OS X it does a few
awesome things and personally I just
prefer to look at this over the default
terminal so I'm going to go ahead and
download this and then let's open that
up and go ahead and install that so drag
that into the application whoops I did
that in desktop go to applications and
then search for I term and open that
beautiful all right so that's good to go
the next one is sublime text it's a
fantastic text editor so I'm going to go
ahead and download this blaim text is a
paid app but you can use it for free it
will just ask you every so often to buy
a license for it and I definitely
recommend you do because a it supports
the indie developers but it's also a
fantastic program so I'm going to go
ahead and install this as well drop that
in my Applications folder open that
beautiful
cool
so to get set up we have a text editor
and we have item as well as Chrome so we
need to now go through the process of
installing a few things in order to
install Ruby and rails on our system so
let's search for homebrew and go to brew
Sh so homebrew is the description is the
missing package manager for OSX
basically it makes it super simple to
install various packages on your system
so all we have to do is copy this line
right here
and go to our terminal I term and paste
that in and then it's going to go
through and run a few scripts this is a
pretty important says the ex cron
command requires the command line
developer tools so you do need to
install the command line developer tools
in order to work with the rails so if
you get this option go ahead and install
all right let's hit done and then all we
have to do is hit return in our password
and it continues oops and it goes out
and downloads and installs homebrew for
us all right so the next thing the
reason we installed homebrew is so that
we could install something called our
BEM or our BM I believe it stands for
Ruby environment so if we go down to let
me search for homebrew as an alternative
to installation on github check out you
can also install our BM and Ruby built
using homebrew package manager so that's
what we're going to do I'll just to be
sure let's do a brute update
I'm sure it's up to date since we just
installed it but just in case alright so
next we need to do brew install our BM
and Ruby - Build paste that in
all right so the reason we installed our
BN is because it makes it super simple
to manage different versions of Ruby on
your system so by default we can do Ruby
- V by default OS X comes with Ruby 2
point 2.0 at least the newer ones do but
we want to use Ruby 2 point 2 point 3 so
let's see install so installing Ruby
version so how we do it we can see a
list of all the available Ruby versions
so if we scroll up to point 2 point 3 is
what we want so the command to do that
RBM install and then the ruby version so
let's do that RBM install two point two
point three this does take a chunk of
time so just be aware that I will jump
back in after this is finished
downloading okay so now that that is
finished installing let's that take a
look and there's a way to set a global
version so our BM global sets a little
to do okay so the command is our BM
global and then the file or the Ruby
version so let's give that try RB m
global and we'll set to point two point
three okay and let's do a Ruby - V hmm
so it's still using ruby 2.0 point O
let's try to figure this out together so
let's do a Google search for at default
Ruby version not changing our bet our BM
so stackoverflow usually has the answer
so let's take a look we're not using zsh
so that's not it I just found the same
problem what I did was uninstall our
p.m. and reinstalled it that'd be
annoying because we just installed it I
fix this by adding following to my bash
profile okay let me try that so I'm
going to copy that
I'm going to do a command open and then
let's do tilde slash bash underscore
profile the file does not exist so we
can do touch till two slash that bash
profile to create that file
and I'll open it then we do the open
command again sweet so that opens up in
TextEdit so all we have to do is paste
that in let's save that and just to be
sure I'm going to quit out and open up I
term again so let's try Ruby - V alright
so Ruby is at now on version two point
two point three perfect so the next
thing we want to do is install rails so
if we go to Ruby on Rails org the latest
is 4.4.4 point two point four so to
install that we simply need to run a
command called gem install rails and
that will go out and fetch the latest
which is four point two point four just
a note this does take quite a long time
much longer than Ruby usually from my
experience so maybe pause this video and
then go grab cup of coffee while this is
finished downloading okay so that says
it's done installing so real quick let's
do rpm rehash so that RBM knows about
the new rails version and let's do rails
- B alright we have rails for point two
point four installed so I'm going to do
something real quick let's see
CD or a change directory into the
documents I'm going to just create a
test application real quick so let's do
rails new I'm going to call this test
underscore app so it's creating the
files for our rails application and
thence doing a bundle install which is
going to go out and fetch all the gems
needed for our application okay so let's
see the into that test app and let's run
the rails server by doing rails server
and let's test it out and see if it
works let's go to localhost port 3000
all right welcome aboard your writing
Ruby on Rails beautiful so everything
has been installed we have a text editor
sublime we have I term for our terminal
and we have chrome for our browser rails
four point two point four is installed
and Ruby 2 point two point three patch
number 173 is installed so we are
looking good and ready to move on in the
series all right guys we are all
finished I just want to say thank you
