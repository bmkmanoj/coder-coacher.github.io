tutorial video created by dev tip 4 and
remarks I sent him a design and we
separately built out the design using
HTML CSS and JavaScript so this is his
video you can find the link to the video
that I made in the description below and
we both came together and discuss the
similarities and differences to our
approaches and that video is also linked
in the description below but for now
here's Andrew so just as a warning
I have never recorded myself programming
anything so let's hope this goes well so
we've got this thing here we're gonna
work on making it a website it's
basically a simple splash page and when
you click on this we get a pop-up that
comes up and then in here it's pretty
simple it talks a little bit about what
you get for signing up and then it's
actually a signup form here with I
believe yeah I've got a placeholder like
enter your email address text box there
so that's kind of nice and then we've
got a little close button up here
although we're gonna make it set up so
that if you click anywhere here it will
actually work for you to close it just
for you no reasons user experience
expectations anyway so file structure is
pretty simple we have an index file with
our HTML in that we've got a sass file
here i use s CSS I realize he's Travis
uses like true sass but I don't I don't
personally like it because I can't read
it very well and then we've got jQuery
which I will use for the simple
JavaScript functionality it's a little
bit overkill of a library but I'm not
that great at true JavaScript and then
we've got our JavaScript file we'll
actually about our code we ever compiled
CSS document I'm actually I use pre pros
to compile everything and then I've got
my three images here we've got a close
button which is this we have this
page description here and then we also
have the actual background of the entire
image this man here it is computer
anyway so that's what we're working with
we'll get started by typing out our HTML
oops
I cannot spell at all we'll set our
title to be something generic like
business websites and say don't actually
have a brand in mine we'll go ahead and
link our CSS document we'll open our
body here at the bottom of it we'll go
ahead and add in our JavaScript files
and then we'll add both of them and then
let's just make sure that we don't have
any glaring errors awesome so the first
thing I want to do is actually set the
background to the website here so we're
gonna set background to be the image
that is / images / background so that's
going to be the man here so if I pull it
up we've got him the next thing we want
to do is have it be repeats that will
get rid of that bottom image we will
make sure that the image is centered and
then fixed and basically what that means
is that if we scroll down and we have
content to scroll the image will stay
fixed in this place and then the center
center makes sure that it's both
vertically and horizontally centered and
then we're also gonna add the special
property of background size here which
when we say cover will mean that this
gets to cover the entire screen
regardless of what the size of my
browser is so as you can see
he's always gonna be him and just one of
him and it will dynamically size itself
accordingly which is pretty handy I will
get a developer tools open here so
because we're going to need that soon so
that's really nice
and that's basically everything from the
body now how do now let's think a little
bit about how we actually want to
structure the HTML for this so I'm
thinking we'll have a container around
the entire thing so we'll put a
container there and then inside of the
container
we'll have this which is gonna have a
consistent height so we can push it down
by 50% and then back up by half of the
height of this and then this will
position relative to these here so that
these stay centered and this is a button
it's always underneath it and to do that
I'm going to have a container for the
entire thing which I'm going to first
put that over there we don't want to
call it we'll call it a hero I guess and
then inside of that we'll have our
message and inside of that we will have
two spans with the good at and then
business and then we'll also have after
the message we'll go ahead and add am
call to action learn more now
and we'll just using carrot D symbol
although actually I'm gonna be smart
about it and we'll do an to greater than
so now if we go over to here we've got
this here you don't actually want to use
the carrot symbols in in HTML just for
partisan reasons so that doesn't look
that great so what we'll do is we'll go
into our CSS and we'll say that the hero
is going to be left there first
position:absolute with a top 50% and a
left safe 40% so now that puts it right
here which is good inside of the hero
we've got wouldn't I call it our message
and that's gonna have a fan which is
gonna beat splay block float:left clear
both good business okay and then we also
want to say action is gonna be clear
both that'll put it at the bottom which
is good and then we want to say that the
span is going to have a background color
black and then we'll also set a variable
for our yellow color here which I will
grab using the dropper
you feel it's gonna be that color so now
when i refresh it
Oh our colors gonna be yellow then we're
gonna say that our font weight is bold
cool the entire website at least so far
is going to be the same open sans font
so I'm gonna go ahead and set that and
I'm gonna go ahead and grab that font
here and import that so now we've got
that and then what we need to do is make
that really big how big is this well I'm
going to go ahead and say that it's
about 84 pixels so we'll say that our
font size is 84 pixels cool do they grab
the font weights appropriately
and a collection use I don't think I got
the bald one
no I only got just the 300 wait now that
should be a little bit bolder cool and
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
add some padding on the left and the
right that 24 pixels so that's gonna
spread that out a little bit we're gonna
add some margin on the top and bottom to
give it a spacing above and below how
much
five pixels yeah I halved it because we
have a margin on the top and bottom so
we only want five pixels on each of them
okay so that's gonna make that nicely
sized and then what we're gonna do is
I'm actually going to use my little tool
here grab this layout so it has a height
of a hundred and fourteen pixels plus
five pixels padding our margin excuse me
so we're too hot basically 115 plus ten
so it's a hundred and twenty-five pixels
for each of these good at and business
of each of these lines so basically
that's a total of 250 but I want to move
up by just one of them so what we're
gonna do is the actual message itself I
figured out is gonna be to do this never
mind
for the hero itself we're gonna say if
it has a margin top of negative 125
pixels so that won't get that nicely
centered and as you can see it stays
centered the only issue I could foresee
being a problem
oops I was grabbing that one is when we
get two widths that are like less than
this although at that point we'd
probably go into a mobile view although
I'm not planning on doing that at least
in this video I might you know do some
kind of a follow up where I make it more
responsive so the next thing is we have
to style this guy down here the call to
action so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
say that it gets to have a background
color
yellow cool we also want to float it
left that way it shrinks that down we're
gonna give it a font size of 23 pixels
and a padding on the left and right of
20 pixels so font size 23 pixels padding
of 20 pixels so now that'll give us a
little bit of a better size cool and
then we're gonna give it also a
font-weight:bold and then we're gonna
actually how tall is it right now that
is that's the question so we're at 32
pixels basically high but we want to be
to get the right padding here because
there's a line I've involved 64 so
basically we need to add 16 pixels on
the top and bottom and padding so I'll
just tack that in right there ooh wait a
minute did I say that this is 32 so
that's 64 and explore it told us that
it's height 32 I guess it looks about
right
and then we also want to give it a
margin top of 5 pixels that will push it
down so that we get the extra 5 pixels
on the top here so that we have the 10
pixel of gap between all of those now so
that's basically complete I would make
it more responsive
we were doing a fully-fledged website
but we're not so the next thing I wanted
to do is give it a pointer cursor so
that when I click on it we're going to
hover my mouse over it it switches to
the pointer which kind of from a user
experience standpoint implies that I can
click on that so what I'm going to do is
now we're going to work on the actual
overlay so let's go back into our HTML
why is this
do I heaven I definitely just had an
extra closing div tag
apologies for anyone who noticed um and
so the next thing is the actual modal
window if you will the modal or whatever
you would call that so what I'm gonna do
is make a class of modal or mode Al and
not really sure how that is said I've
heard it both ways and here we go let's
make it a fixed position because we're
always gonna have it be in the top left
origin and we're always gonna have it be
full width and height so that we get
that yellow effect so we're gonna say
top of zero left of zero and they're
also gonna say 100% width and 100%
height and background color of yellow
that'll hover over here although I don't
want it to be quite that yellow I
actually want it to be slightly
transparent how much transparent does he
have it let's just not be the designer
here he did that so we'll do point 9
yeah that seems about right
although okay that was weird it kind of
cut off that for just a second
oops okay so um what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna have I'm just gonna call
it a box we're gonna have a box on the
inside that's gonna be this actual
region here inside of that box we're
gonna have a couple of things we can
have a close button and we'll come back
to that later
but we're also going to have we're gonna
basically have a top a bottom
and then the top section is going to be
divided into a left half and a right
half
I'm just trying to think about what to
call each of those things
we'll call the top half content since
that's kind of the content we'll call
the bottom half form since that's the
form and then inside of the content area
we're going to have we're gonna have
sample pages that's this right-hand
region here and then we're also gonna
have what do I want to call that I'm
really bad at naming stuff uh I'm gonna
be really not creative here and we're
gonna call it left half
I really cannot come up a name for that
and I apologize for the bad you know
semantic naming here so let's go back to
here and we'll refresh the page you'll
notice we don't really have anything
different since I didn't put anything in
any of these oh and then left half will
have title and then
body I'm so bad at naming stuff so for
the title we've got business stuff and
your inbox all the time and for the body
we've got sign up for our news letter -
down but this 200 plus page I could have
just copied that I realize and then in
the sample pages thing we're going to
set the image actually with CSS to make
sure it's absolutely positioned
correctly now to actually style it we're
going to come into here and we're gonna
set up the box so the box is going to
have a position of absolute which means
it will be positioned relative to the
top left point of the parent which is
because the parents position fixed so
we'll set its left to be 50% and its top
to be 50% we will set a width and height
on that box
it'd be really really precise here 600
by 360 and then a background color light
and then we're gonna say that has a
margin top of - we're gonna do half of
the widths 180 pixels I could set
variables for these things and actually
do the math but I don't actually think
that's necessary for this scale of a
project so that'll get us oops that
needs to be margin left that'll get us
nice and centered there and then inside
of the box we have the close button
which would come back to me we've got
content and form so the content in here
so first the form is gonna have a height
of 97 pixels 97 pixels and a width a
percent which means the content right I
just grabbed my my iPhone here so 360 -
97 is 263 so that means the height of
this is going to be 263 pixels the width
is still 100% now if we zoom out here
you'll notice that we have black behind
the form elements here so I'm gonna just
set it background color of black oops
so now if I come back here we'll have
the form section at the bottom and then
if I come in too
just hear it you get I Can I grab
properties um so this actually has a
width of 257 pixels so we're gonna set
the width of the image are the sample
pages here to be what did I just say it
was
I cannot remember now 257 so we're gonna
set simple pages to be 257 pixels wide
the height of this is gonna be a hundred
percent we can do that because the
parent we have a fixed height here and
so it'll just fill that up and then I'm
gonna actually set the background image
of this right now to just be dot Ossus
images slash what did I call it
pages dot G go back I got this here and
what we want to do is we actually want
to go ahead and float this left which is
going to bring it above that and then we
want to say that our left half I cannot
believe that I did not name that
something better but we'll go with it
for now
is gonna actually have a width that is
600 pixels so the width of this entire
thing minus the width of this which is
257 so that is three hundred and
forty-three pixels and a height of one
hundred percent and we're gonna float it
left cool so that's going to position
those things correctly now inside of the
left half and
I also realized that I may not want to
be nesting this stuff so deep because
their actual output CSS we're getting
like really long selectors here but for
now I'm not gonna worry about that
because I'm not making this terribly
optimized CSS file right now so in the
left-half we're gonna have our title and
that's going to have a font size of 23
pixels and a font weight of bold refresh
that and then we're also gonna give it
padding of 30 pixels so that'll move
that over nicely and I actually don't
like the way that that's looking so what
I'm gonna do is actually increase the
font size like 28 really there we go
that just looks a little bit cleaner
with a little bit larger type and then
what we're gonna do for the body which
is this right here we're gonna give it
the same padding except only on the left
and right so that'll move it over we're
gonna give it a font-weight:bold
but then what we're gonna do is we're
actually going to decrease the color
we're gonna make it kind of that's a
pretty light grant that gray you get the
color
9 which will make it nice and light and
then also I noticed that took up three
lines um hmm how do we want to do that
he's got it kind of moved over there so
I'm gonna do that in a fantastic way
where I simply make that a big number on
the padding on the right hand side here
so that it pushes that text down I
actually want to increase that until
there we go now it looks right that is
that is not a terribly great solution
but it gets the job done
I could have changed the width of it but
this does effectively the same thing and
then what I'm gonna do is set its line
height to be about 1.2 m/s what that's
gonna do is that's gonna so it's good
like 1.4 that's just gonna increase the
distance between between lines that
looks too much cool so that's gonna make
it look fairly similar to this like I
said it's not going to be pixel perfect
but it just cuz the fonts different so
now that we'll do the close button next
and so that's pretty easy close button
is gonna have a position of absolute and
we're gonna say that it gets a left of a
hundred percent and a bottom of a
hundred percent there margin left
so basically we're up here's our
reference point we're gonna put a margin
left of 15 pixels weight 10 pixels and a
margin bottom of 10 pixels that was
phenomenal typing okay so that's gonna
do is nothing because I haven't set a
width of 24 pixels and a height of 24
pixels yet and a background image of
data / images / X dot PNG so that's
gonna put that there why is that gray
did I have a background in ha
I saved that without the new
transparency looks good and fix that so
we will grab this here and we'll select
the X layer create a new file that's 24
by 24 ooh let's just hide all that stuff
we will copy that trash trash
hey now you've got a transparent
background that is
okay I said that is a PNG image to
retain the chance parentsí and yes okay
I don't know how that ended up that way
the first time cuz that's exactly what I
did to save it okay so that's there and
then I'm also gonna just preemptively
say that the closed cursors are gonna
have a pointer so basically that's gonna
be so that when we hover our mouse over
and it gives us the impression that we
can click on it because the pointer so
now let's do the form so that's going to
be underneath the content I've already
got to thing here so inside of the form
we're gonna have two sections we're
gonna have an input type of text and I'm
just gonna give that a class email I'll
go and put email here for auto
completion was sake and then we're also
gonna have a submit and then value is
going to equal what does he have set
see just this a bit okay then I come
back here we've got a beautiful form so
first input we're gonna say that it gets
each of these gets box-sizing order box
and that means that when I set a width
and a height and then add padding the
padding is gonna come out of the actual
width and height of the I object instead
of adding to it if that makes any sense
that's just something you get used to
when you start working with like the box
model so let's figure out how big these
need to be 57 pixels so we're gonna
height 57 pixels and a padding of 20
pixels so what that means is that when I
come over here cool
and then we're gonna do a margin so
that's say 20 pixels I can get 20 pixels
so now perfect and then what I'm gonna
do is on the actual submit button margin
left zero that would just get rid of the
extra margin we've got there so now
let's figure out how wide this needs to
be using some very scientific process
380
cool and then submit button it's gonna
be 160 and we're gonna set each of these
gets no border where's the extra space
coming from here
376
I said that it's got a width of 383 36
oh it's 336 cuz I scroll this down to
376 yeah see there's a little black gap
right here and I don't know what that is
oh it's because these are inline
elements display:block float:left there
we go
they're inline elements and so it sees
the white space between this as
basically a space character like the
space between words here and so it adds
that space in there so now what we're
gonna do on each of these inputs to say
that it gets a font family I hate that
you have to specify this again but we do
so font Henley condensed
font-weight:bold what did he have as the
placeholder he had enter your email
address
now we've got a placeholder and then
we're also gonna give each of these a
font size of approximately 14 pixels
does that look right first trick it's a
background color yellow
I make color it's already got a color
black cool that looks that looks pretty
good box actually know that I think
about it needs to get a shadow so that
see others kind of in this there's a
shadow around the edge here I'm just
gonna kind of wing the shadow 0 0 30
pixels you know black I don't actually
know if that's gonna look right a little
bit much let's go and let's reduce it a
little bit
that looks pretty similar I'm gonna make
it actually like 18 pixels and point to
floor reduce it a tiny bit boy those
shadows look pretty silly I'm happy with
that so now I guess it's time to work on
the JavaScript although I'm gonna go
ahead and actually do one more thing
I'm going to wrap this inform tags so
that when you press ENTER actually
hanging I don't want that to actually
validate that for me so I'm gonna remove
the email it actually knows to submit
the form actually I'm going to do that
it is a way I don't like that so the one
other thing I want to do stylistically
is in the submit button I think it
should have a pointer cursor to let you
know that you can click there we need to
figure out how to make this appear and
disappear what we can do is say that
opacity of none which is or the Moodle
is a whole passive none although it's
still here like you'll notice I can't
see it but I can like type in the box
here which doesn't really make sense but
what I can do is actually set something
called pointer events to none basically
what that's going to do it's gonna
basically make it so it doesn't exist
clicking on it isn't going to trigger
trigger any JavaScript events or
anything like that
oops so we're gonna explore bugs since
I'm in developer mode thanks internet
explorer so that's kind of any technique
that I use it does not work in anything
older than Internet Explorer 11 and so
you would want to implement fallbacks
but since I have IE 11 and it works in
Chrome Firefox and opera and Safari
there really isn't a reason that you
can't implement it as long as you
implement a fallback for IE so if we go
into our JavaScript file let's go ahead
and get an event handler set up to tell
when the document is ready why are you
giving me an air can i there I don't
want that to give me an error so what
I'm gonna do is in here I'm going to
select this here which we called call to
action and we're gonna set an event such
that when I click on it I'm going to run
a function and that function is going to
open the modal yes now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to define that function
down here and what that's going to do is
it's actually going to select HTML and
we're gonna add a class of modal open
cool so what that's going to do is when
I click on here you'll notice we get a
class of modal open here what that means
is that when I come in to here I can
actually say that when the modal's open
you can grab the modal and set its
opacity to 1 and it's point events to
all so basically when I click on this
now it pops up with the thing now that's
great except that it's not well animated
but the advantage of doing it through
CSS is I can simply implement
a transition of say opacity 0.2 seconds
he's in out I don't know it's not I
click on it it fades in which is nice
which which it which is actually pretty
nice I'm actually gonna do one more
thing wherein instead of being a margin
top of 180 we're actually gonna make a
margin top of negative 200 so it's gonna
be a little bit above where we want it
to be to be perfectly centered as you'll
notice if I scroll we're a little bit
above the actual center point here and
then so what I'm going to do here is say
that when the modal open the actual
modal itself is going to change them
when the modal's open we're gonna change
the box such that it has a margin top of
minus 180 pixels so then when I click on
this that's centered and then if I come
up here and actually animate that I
click on this why aren't you working oh
I have it set to transition opacity on
the transition margin so now why aren't
you working
oh I need to transition this margin so
now that's gonna kind of fade in a
little bit and slide down as the
background fades in which is nice now
what I want to do is I want to select
the close button when I click close
modal and then I'm going to define a
function of closed modal and when I do
that instead of adding that class I
remove that class so now click on this
click on that click on this click on
that so the next the next thing that I'd
like to do is have it so that if I click
on this yellow space here it closes it
as well so the way I can set that up is
by saying if I click on the modal itself
close the modal so now that works like
you'd expect
however it also works like if I try to
type my email oh no it would disappeared
you know that does that doesn't work
well so what I need to do is I'm going
to pass in a parameter of event so that
I can actually access things about it so
I'm going to say if the event I'm not
gonna go and do like a full JavaScript
tutorial here that might be some other
day I don't know but if the event target
so basically what jQuery does is it sets
up this object called event and it
passes it into the callback function
that is this thing and one of the
properties it defines is the target and
so what target is is it's the thing you
actually clicked on it doesn't include
things that are the children elements
like any of this box or any of the boxes
children and so we can do is we can
actually use the this keyword
and the event.target and see if they're
the same so if a vent up target is equal
to this what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say closed modal so now if i
refresh it and I click on the yellow it
closes but if I click on the inside it
works just as you would expect which is
pretty handy and then also the close
button if appear obviously still works
so that that that's how you would do
something like that now there are a
million different ways to implement
something like this and that's kind of
the point of these videos that we were
make these videos this video that we
were making with wow I can't speak the
purpose of the video that me and Travis
are making right now so that's pretty
much everything I had for this yep
anyway so um I will put all of this code
on github Travis may include a link in
the description I don't know I haven't
talked about that with him yet I
realized that this code is not well
optimized whatsoever
and that things that I did like this
pointer events trickery you would have
to create fallback solutions for for
older browsers and then also this sass
files a little bit of a mess because I'm
nesting really deeply and also I didn't
name things terribly well and I'm a I
type some redundant code but it gets the
point across as far as a method by which
you could implement something like this
and also for the record I don't know if
it will have already been mentioned I am
NOT a web developer I develop apps so
this isn't something that I normally do
and so I was a little bit out of
practice anyway that's how I made this
design in code
