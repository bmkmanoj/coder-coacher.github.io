running this channel is the interaction
and engagements that I get from all of
you guys now I do my very best at
responding to every comment that's left
on every video and for the most part I'm
successful and one of the most requested
videos here is to do a complete project
from start to finish so that's what
we're going to be doing today or rather
this month or however long it takes to
finish it so it's going to be a whole
series and I'm pretty excited about it
these videos will cover my whole process
from start to finish and the outline
we've broken down something like this
week one which is starting today we're
going to look at ideation and discovery
and also we're going to look at project
organization and manage week two we're
going to look at sketching and wire
framing and also visual design week 3
we're going to take a closer look on the
platform the technology on which we'll
be building this project and then after
that we'll be coding it and laying it
out and well I'll be taking you guys
with me step by step I haven't really
thought about much too far out because I
want to be making decisions as we go
together even the outline that I just
gave you a subject to change because I
haven't done any of this yet and we'll
see how things go ok that's it this
video is just an intro video to the
entire series so to get started click on
Kanye's face right here it's so
beautiful click on Kanye's face and
they'll take you to the first video in
which we talk about ideation discovery
and project management alright let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
