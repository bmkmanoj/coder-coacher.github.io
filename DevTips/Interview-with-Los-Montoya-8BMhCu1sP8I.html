and this is my boy in Z we're just
walking around the neighborhood right
now
but I just want to let you know this has
been a stressful week for me kids have
all been sick I've been sick so I
haven't been able to make any human I've
been able to make a new video but I got
this one in the in the bag in the safe
the archive don't want to share with you
remember a while ago where mmm Louis
came over and we talked about cascading
nature of stylesheets no well that was
fun and after he helped me with that
video we stood around and chatted for a
while and so that's what I'm going to
show you today just like a little bit of
this I guess you'd call it an interview
with Louis and where we talk about his
path and we talk about kind of what it's
like to be working out here and I'm
doing what we're doing and and just how
this all affects us with life and having
families and everything we do so anyway
I hope you guys can enjoy it and forgive
me for not making a new tutorial
instructional video today or this week
but next week I'll have something really
good for you not that this isn't gonna
be good you're gonna like it but
something more along lines of what
you're used to all right guys take care
and remember to subscribe down below and
share this with your friends bye
okay everybody this is a special edition
of dev tips we're not even really
talking about development right now this
is Louis Louis Montoya calm so I was
talking to Louis Louis is very similar
to myself in that we're both uneducated
professionals in other words we didn't
go to college we taught ourselves most
you know everything we knew through
experience and through like tenacious
study and there's something that I
really admire and appreciate about
people the do this the choose this path
rather than paying for for you know like
a college education member so anyway
Louis I'm gonna ask you a few questions
for the camera yeah go ahead
so what made you even decide to be your
professional designer you make mobile
apps for a company that you probably
have heard of they probably use you can
say that you want they what made you
decide to get into design Jim jump on
the boat so so I did I did go to school
a little bit okay
I sorry I did go to school for a little
bit I probably did an equivalent of over
here I'm gonna do that well I wasn't I
think that while I was doing I thought
like I you know Louis wants me in
scratch right yeah you didn't do that
well I didn't prioritize my time okay so
it wasn't that was a skill or they used
to prioritize my time around it
I had a girl I was young and her
girlfriend and she like that's my wife
no anyway so that happened and then I
life life happened and I was like I need
to do something and my wife looks pretty
much like hey you like art just do
something with part right this is before
this business this is after after
because I saw after you went to art
school she said hey you like art no so
is that her of observing I went to art
school
something tells
I went to an art school before I met
okay then I then we got married they
tried to like University of Phoenix or
something like that and I was just the
dumbest year ever anyway it got to the
point where I didn't want to keep doing
what I was doing at the time and then
and I wasn't happy with my life and so
my wife she was like you just need to do
art again just dude that brought you joy
right right and it just so happened that
a friend of mine she needed a website
and I just I just dope in and started
doing and and then and then I jumped
into Photoshop and it just it was just
like a snowball affair you just
progressed and progressed and progressed
but the key thing was that I just I just
kept showing up yeah okay yeah that's
fantastic I listen to a podcast by a
crisp choir in Dave Rupert it's called
shop Talk it's really nerdy I recommend
it to all my normal dev tips for
designers subscribers slash Watchers
it's really great but one of the
interesting things about that podcast is
that people often write in or email in
or whatever and they say oh where should
I start where do I begin or whatever in
their answer always is easy even out
like a sound buy it so they don't have
to repeat themselves they're there where
do I start their answer is just build
websites just do it yeah don't like try
to learn this first or try to get good
it or meet somebody or take this class
just start building right now because
you're gonna learn something that you're
gonna take into your next project or out
and so forth so what do you do now
because now you have a professional job
you're we are a professional you're in
the professional workforce I say
professional enough what do you do now I
mean if you write right so so I have a
day job right so I go to work and I just
do my thing right but when I get home
that's where the real growth happens I
I've set up a routine every day at 9:30
p.m. I walk down to my office
or your laptop or wherever and I just
show up
if even if I don't have anything that I
want to do or if I'm just lazy I'm just
tired if you just show up you're gonna
do something and just force yourself to
go there anyway so that's what I do is I
just show up that reminds me a vote any
other Woody Allen quote or Woody
Harrelson one of the Woody's either the
old guy or the murderer I don't know one
of them so sadly there was a woody what
and that could be you could be in it but
he said 99% of the job is to just show
up and I think they just yeah I'm just
repeating what you said but putting a
woody behind it yeah so anyway just show
it huh
yeah just show up so I just show up and
and there are many things that I'm good
at now because I've shown up right and
and that's comfortable and what I do is
I work on things that make me
uncomfortable you have to push yourself
and every night I try to do something
pushes me a little bit more in the
uncomfortable zone like a fog yeah yeah
so yeah so that's what I do is I I I
have a routine I show up and I am
constantly unconquered that's fantastic
for the past similar in my family life I
have two kids and a wife a lot of people
that want my attention and it was really
difficult actually you know in our
marriage and our family life early on to
like balance these things and tell my
wife and I sat down and we said okay you
can and we made a schedule similar to
what it seems like happen with you and I
have two nights a week where I can run
down to the garage and make videos
before that I was actually doing client
work a side side work or or just making
crap that I like my website itself is
full just weird explorations but what's
interesting about this is two things
number one every time that I've taken
the opportunity to work for myself and
to show up on
extracurricular times every time though
influences and the things that I make
directly impact impact my work for my
employers it always impacts for a
positive the work that I do
professionally for example and I've got
it doing this this dev tips thing this
is really weird and new for me I've
never ever thought about making YouTube
channel and now that I've done it by the
way I work for a company who makes
analytics for YouTube content creators
and that's what kind of spurned the idea
even but now that I've done it I have
like so much more empathy for my clients
who are YouTube youtubers and also I I'm
actually making videos at work for the
youtubers of how to use our product it's
really interesting so things always leak
into to my professional life it's the
second point is that every movement I've
made in my career every new job offer
I've gotten or everything is always
without without exception always as a
response to my personal work my self
initiated work is always how I get the
next job or how somebody finds me it's
never because oh you meant know this guy
or because oh I saw that you worked on
this team or made this product it's
always because like hey you did that one
weird thing to me that I met on a log
and that's interesting what else do you
do it's always because of that yeah yeah
I've seen that
more specifically just things bleeding
over into my professional life like just
just the fact that you're working on
developing other skill sets most likely
it'll doesn't even have to do with your
doing what you're doing yeah absolutely
right yeah but it just bleeds over for
example recently I was like I want to be
a photographer anyway I just started
taking pictures you talk first so I
joined Instagram
hi I'm honest your game though you are
somebody 90s I just picked up a camera
and just started taking pictures and
pictures of pictures and learning all
the configurations in manual mode and
what that was and I was lost I was lost
for the longest time my stuff look
crappy and then it clicked then Inc no
pun intended it literally clicked and
from that point on I was able to kind of
continue pushing myself and pushing
myself and I'm still very novice in
photography but I think I have a handle
of the basic foundational skills to to
move before and I think that's what I
did when I developed that first website
ever made and take any Casas or anything
I just did it and force myself to just
learn foundational things that have
carried me a long way yeah it's cool and
when you start you don't really have a
clear picture of where you're gonna end
up and that's really okay you have this
nugget of a vision and as you go and
make different decisions in different
turns your the vision actually changes
at the end the end product is totally
not what you thought it was going to be
but it's always valuable for example
this whole dev tips thing right I was
talking to my wife earlier today and
she's like when you started flying sheet
rocket hanging in the garage and when
you bought a a lighting kit I was like
this is ridiculous she told me that
today and and then but now she's been
seeing the videos that I've been making
and and I showed her the video I made it
work and she and and how my colleagues
really understand and respect what I'm
doing now right when that first were I
told him what I was going to do they
yeah and and one last thing I wanted to
say about self-initiated work whenever
I've been in the position of hiring
another creator or designer I'm always
asking that like what do you do when
you're not being paid to do something or
when you're not being asked to do
something what are you passionate about
and if they tell me cooking
oh that's cool look I love that you love
cooking and I'm sure that's gonna make
your way into your professional work
somehow because you know like video his
dad is right there's always proper cross
reference of your source material right
like I'm lately I'm very interested in
history I don't know how that's
influencing no work I'm sure of it but
something that directly influences like
if you want to make websites if you're a
subscriber to dev tips for designers you
want to learn how to make websites or if
you're just thinking this is funny this
guy whatever if you want to make
websites they just keep going keep
watching keep traveling out like in dev
tips I give you pointers like I point
you out what to look at and what to do
but I'm not doing it for you like the
only one that can help you make good
websites is you by making good websites
yeah let me let me jump on let me jump
on that point go and I recently had
opportunities to hire people yeah and
and my main question my main driving
force was kind of like the yeah or name
for them was exactly that it's no but I
phrased it differently I said what do
you do on the side that's pointless for
yourself where you have 100% autonomy
right because when you're professionally
professionally working or just with
clients you have about 80 to 90% of time
to me if you're like all right there's a
lot of stakeholders yeah of courts
decisions and so if you are creative you
need an outlet where you just have full
control of it
so if you don't have one pick something
and just have full autonomy like Chavez
saying and it won't believe bleed into
your life it's as a creator just I don't
know just melt candles over a log no
it's in a corner of your room that's not
there right now what does that mean
literally melting canvas first you take
cinnamon toast crunch the menu peanut
butter and then you light him on fire
and then after that you you squirrels
you entices the squirrels to come and
then you build a montage of squirrel
bones that's what you do I understand I
mean who knows who knows that maybe
candles
so there's a it's it's it's in the
corner of my office I have a log that I
brought my peach and I've stood it up I
have candles on there and is a Halloween
victory no no it's just candles on a
lock you're doing a sales no and I'm
just about I'm just melting this isn't
when you're working at night this is
just this ever periodic I check my
candles today I'm sure there's melted
wax there I'm gonna just drip it
whatever it's a full autonomy no one can
tell me otherwise don't do that and it
just liberates me just gives me creative
freedom that really allows me to focus
at work or focus when I need to focus
most people just Twitter all right it's
been a really great conversation I
appreciate you as a person as human for
coming into my garage where nobody else
would yeah I'm here
wood that's it again if you are watching
