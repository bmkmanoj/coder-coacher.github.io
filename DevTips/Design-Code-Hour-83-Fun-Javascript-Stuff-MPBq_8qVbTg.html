call design and code my personal website
in 12 hours ah but you knew that by now
because you're smart and only smart
people watch dev tips and that's a fact
I knew that because I looked it up in my
analytics you know you scroll down it's
in their demographics smart people just
saying ok enough talking here's some old
traffic
hey did you miss me oh I missed you I
was sitting here for like a whole day
you know it's like a little weird and
they coming back
YouTube no just kidding I was like one
minute a guy just stopped and started
recording but anyway what we're gonna do
today is we're gonna jump back into the
articles section and we're gonna add a
little we're gonna add a little sparkle
and shine and you know just like to make
it more interesting like these other
ones here this one gots the parallax
this one gots the whatever that is and
this one got some nothing gots nothing
you gots nothing now have a look a
little so here's what we're gonna do
let's go to let's use the internet and
look up animate animate CSS why do I
wanted to animate CSS because they don't
feel like writing this all out myself so
we're gonna look at animate CSS and
let's go to the tada so every time it's
not like this one second right like this
tada
okay let's just viewed on kid let's not
download the whole thing viewed on
github and go to your source this is
from Dan Eden who is a boss and
attention seekers and tada this is what
we want this tada so let's grab this
tada grab that Ted dah and we're gonna
put it at the bottom here and you notice
that it's in CSS format or scss format
it's actually just CSS so what we'll do
is do the find in our browser and lure
our code editor and will replace all of
those with those replace all of these
with these and replace all of that with
that's okay now it's a CSS wonderful
let's get rid of a few these lines here
okay keyframes tada and now it says
transform scale and it has those
keyframes and we don't have like you
know like - WebKit - Moz and that's fine
just remember we're using autoprefixer
so don't worry about that don't worry
about it
and we need to go to the thing that it's
gonna get animated and say animation
name tada and get rid of that the thing
that's gonna get animated is the article
thumb and we need to go to get something
else go to the base - we need to get
these base things animated means to have
these as well
okay so put those on the yeah okay let's
go check it out refresh
see they're all done that's not what we
want but it's close so let's make a
class for an article thumb and we'll say
if you're and only one that cost like a
emphasize write is M is if if your is M
then you get the animation all right so
let's simulate this come on okay we'll
find one of these guys there and order
per group
okay is emph so when I hit off of this
this article thumb should dance okay
perfect
so is f works now I need to do a little
fun stuff like that will just you know
allow me to add is amp randomly onto any
of their numbers right so if we want to
add fun stuff we go to the
fine we type funny there now just go to
functions sure of course
all right now we want to create a new
function called we want to call this
let's call it article tada and here's
how it works the article tada we're
gonna take make a random number right
because we want to choose any of them at
any time and random rand num is equal to
math with a capital m floor and then
we're gonna do a math again with a
random and then what takes out random
times what times however many things are
well basically the upper limit of the
number of the randoms we want to get
which is actually if we just count the
article thumbs and then say bling that's
how many there are plus 1 because we
want to offset it because it's 0 index
counting okay that's the random number
now that we have a random number random
selection of these let's take it let's
take that article thumb was it percent
it should be dolla dolla bill y'all
oh that's wrong too it's a percent
should be a dollar okay
article - thumb and we're gonna say EQ
means EQ is a jQuery thing it means take
the selection of the selected object
this run right here will grab all 12 of
them and this will say narrow it down to
like the third or the second or the
sixth one but we want to narrow it down
to R and num so whatever the random
number returns that's the number that we
want to choose of them narrow it down
there and add the class
is M right and then we want to go to all
of the siblings of the one we chose and
we want to just make sure make sure that
it doesn't have a class of is amp on it
because that would be bad if they all
had is amp right they all be balancing
all the time so so we have a function
here that will find a random one of
these guys and add an is M to it let's
run this function see what happens are
you gonna bounce you know mounts one of
them should bounce have a beer D do
bounced okay now it only bounced once
and only one of them bounced once which
is fine but what we wanted to be doing
is bouncing like one of them all the
time so we're gonna stick this function
here into a another JavaScript thing
it's called set interval enter Val
now what this will do is it'll set up a
time to whatever function so after this
comma I'm gonna write at time let's say
4 seconds or 4,000 milliseconds and I'll
put this function as a callback inside
of this function now every 4 seconds
another one of these should go just
saying oh yeah
hey-oh click me is it happening are you
doing that why is it no working while
you make me so sad so sad all the time I
don't know why it's not working okay
let's look critically at what we're
doing here
we have a function and then we put it ah
here we are set it needs to be a capital
I
because there's no I in set interval
except for the capital I that you didn't
put a capital
so let's now let's let's do it now it's
gonna do it I've I have faith I have
hope
yes that face okay do another one haha
another one ah every four seconds we got
a little tete da da da cool all right so
this is fantastic this is exactly what I
wanted what else can we do what I want
to do though what I really want to do
though is I want to do when you know
when you're scrolling down basically
like this is I'm on the top here and I
scroll down and I get to the mentoring
section these things pop up and that's
cool like oh oh give my attention I'm a
user and like oh oh if something moved
I'm like a t-rex I'm a t-rex asaurus
that grabbed my attention
and these things are grabbing my
attention to the little bit little Ted
oz oh I love it wait a second do I love
it I don't love something about it did
you see that watch what watch watch
watch you see that you see how the tada
is still under the next one right there
the lady okay the lady space was on top
of the little seat okay okay what we
need to do Greco's articles okay is f
you know what you need you need a
z-index change to change your life
look a z-index let's take a look now the
next amp should be on top of everything
around it you don't count you're on the
end
mmm you don't count either come on show
me
nailed it okay where were we
oh yes scrolling down and having things
happen while you scroll down that's what
we want to happen to us and we already
have a scroll function right here start
mentoring let's make us start articles
and its finest start mentoring and go
right and below it let's go right above
it because if mentoring has other stuff
attached to it all right
function start articles that's a nice
sound to it start articles start are
tickles
start articles and in our start articles
section function rather we want to do
this you know grab this scroll like we D
we don't have that variable there and
then we want to say if the articles
basically like this right same thing
boop-boop does it really say - 400 or -
500 okay here's the thing okay here's
the thing this is a hard number - 500
and what it is right here remember last
week we said if we scroll into the
viewport negative 500 pixels we're gonna
pop this what is it I'm gonna add launch
to the mentoring section so let me just
demonstrate this for you refresh there's
nothing in that mentoring section right
green screen somewhere there as we
scroll and we get like 500 pixels from
let's actually count adapt should be a
rad by out right here as we get around
here they will pop see that okay the
problem with that is what if your screen
is only yay large let's go back to the
top refresh now 500
for now 500 is down inside here so they
should already be popped by the time we
get to it say less less fun less
exciting why don't we say instead of
negative 500 we'll say - - what - the
window though height - divided by 2 so
minus half of the window height so no
it's not about pixels anymore it's about
dimensions so when this line this blue
line gets to about half this will show
or never show what did I be wrong window
- window hayek oh it's it's breaking
because of this if statement I need to
finish my JavaScript for other
JavaScript but we'll watch ok so now it
should work okay right when this blue
line gets to about half way it should
okay see now this should be better
because if we are like this again it is
blue line refresh this blue line will be
half of the screen before these things
and I'll give you give the time for the
user to notice it right so I like that
better rather than saying - 500 let's do
that here - let's grab this again okay
now it's not a section mentoring this
time it's sectioned articles article
articles what section are you articles
okay if if this is in position we want
to throw out a function what's our
function or function is going to be
we're gonna identify these article
thumbnails
and we'll say for each of them to do
with this function oh and here we want
to keep track of which one they are so
I'll just put I for iterator and for
each one of these we want to grab grab
one of them and I'm not saying this for
a reason I'll show you why we want to
grab one of them and the one that we
want to grab I already explained to you
EQ is I so let me explain that
so each happens and what that each does
is it says it loops for each one in in
the object so remember when I say this
is all 12 so 12 of them are in the
jQuery object and then the function of
each iterates this next portion of the
function for each one it loops 12 times
and I captures the number of the loop so
this if it if the loop is on the fourth
loop this will be find the fourth
article thumb right okay so find that
one and then add a class we just add
classes that's what we're just so classy
is visible this is a bull that's
houseboat and that's cool so let's save
that and then let's check these guys out
okay do they have they don't have the
class oh that all happened at once
they all got the clap the class is
visible which is good that's what we
want so let's go back to our say ass
article thumb and say opacity zero and
is visible opacity one and then
transition of course and then transition
to make that happen like a fade in
transition all 30 300 milliseconds and
ease in I feel like I write this a lot I
should like make a mix enter variable or
something okay that looks good
cool let's refresh okay see how they all
faded in like that that's exactly what I
want to happen but I want them to happen
one at a time in the way that you do
that let's go back to this function and
put it in a set time out put it in a
time out now a set time out is is a
another JavaScript key thing that's
similar to what we did with set
iteration or set it set interval set
timeout function
yeah yeah okay now and all right so the
set timeout is says wait for a moment
and then run what's inside of this
function but how long should I wait
it shall wait 300 seconds
okay let's refresh scroll it waited 300
seconds and then it loaded them all in
that's not what we wanted we wanted them
to wait 300 seconds from the last one
well fantastic
that's really easy to do because we
remember we captured the number that
it's on
so we'll say three hundred times that
number now if you're 300 times one it's
300 right but the second one will take
600 milliseconds and the third one and
so on right so let's rebuild and refresh
and they're fresh here we go see that
doo doo doo doo doo and then it popped
up I love it was kind of musical that's
wonderful
we did this actually we did this already
in another tutorial on the parallax
serious which is fine it's good to reuse
those things that we know all right
I'm happy what do you guys think so we
got let's just refresh let's just
refresh this scroll down these are
popping up at the right time now in the
middle here these would be like Boop
maybe that's taking a little long maybe
we'll say 200 yeah I'm into it I'm in -
