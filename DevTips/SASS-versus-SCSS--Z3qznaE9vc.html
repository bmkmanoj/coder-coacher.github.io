of the night I did work on the first
video this evening
I finished it up this is the sixth video
tonight and I am gonna go to bed soon I
promise but I wanted to give you though
that one last cut tip tip or whatever I
guess it's just me complaining about
SCSS more but let me show you why I like
SAS better than SCSS please view the
screen I have here a bracketed version
of the code that we wrote to to display
this list of Oliver age 25 right it's
that it's the same code it just rewrote
it for SCSS and and look at it it's just
got it's got these um semicolons
everywhere it's got these brackets
everywhere do a quick fine for how many
brackets got eleven of these brackets ah
yeah should I blow into those brackets
- how many semicolons do I have 25 extra
so so 25 extra semicolons
you know 22 extra brackets
it's just unsatisfactory to me let's
compare that with the SAS oh wow look at
that I feel like I can breathe it again
it's a 47 lines of code
this is 58 so 11 more lines of code just
in it's just four brackets that's the
only reason we have extra code is
because we want more brackets it gets
really messy right here when you're out
nesting when you're getting out of the
nesting situation leave those three ugly
brackets I don't know how that helps you
other than to confuse you if I want to
move that span oh my god I'm nesting too
far now I want to move this spin out of
a child nest look what I have to do I
have to take this bracket and put it
back with its parent put that where it
should be and then move this back out
put some space in between them and then
clean this out here that was a lot of
work now let me show you this same same
output in the same the same code in SAS
s little output the same CSS breath of
fresh air if I want to outdent that spam
on it unnecessarily and it's so easy to
do I can then put it back I can out get
all of these at once
I mean it's holy moly okay let's compare
side-by-side what I'll pull out this
scss look at how messy this one is on
the right now clean the one is on the
left not only that look at the syntax
there's shortcuts in the syntax in SAS s
that are not available in s CS SS CSS
and so verbose for example if I want to
call and mix in in SAS s I just use this
little plus sign and then the name of
the mixin in SCSS I have to write at
include space the name of the mix in
at include its so many unnecessary
characters it's so easy just do to do a
plus sign and look even to define them
examine how many mix-ins to find right
now but if I'm going to define a mix in
I'm gonna write actually I'll show you
first in the SCSS alright at mixed in my
mixin and if you like font size 30
pixels okay that's the mix in that's how
you write a mix in SCSS that's a ss
equal equals my mix in font size 30
pixels look at that that's the
difference an equal sign one for right
app mix in why would I need to write
extra characters I think maybe I'm being
nitpicky but like this is like when I'm
writing thousands of lines of code every
character is sacred know every second
spent obsessing over like - you know
it's just a waste of time it's a waste
of time and a waste of like cognitive
load right at mixin is it at mixin is it
at include is it at import now it's just
a plus sign it's a plus sign it's way
better yeah I like dang semicolons like
after using sass for a long time like
regular CSS is a nightmare in terms of
just like how ugly it is to look at and
to read and you know the main reason
people this is more of a rant than a tip
I guess it's turning out to be the main
reason that people like s CSS the main
reason that I read in their tutorials
and their blogs and whatever I read a
book I read a book um is it my con I
read a book recently
sass for designers by the guy who made
dribble Dan cedar home and he was like
oh yeah there's also as a it's this but
as CSS is so wonderful and the reason he
chooses it and this is the same reason
that other authors have explained the
reason they choose it is because you
don't have to learn a new syntax you can
take your existing CSS slap an S in
front of the extension so it week s CSS
and voila it's invalid as the incidence
now while that's true
it's useless why does that who cares
about that and I guess I don't know I
started with it too actually I started
in less which is even more fiddly
well not fiddly but I started in less
and they use that was like they're
selling point those designers don't need
to learn a new language use your
existing CSS and just start using
variables and nesting things while I
like I can understand the argument for
like newbies like for people who are
just like what is a preprocessor
preprocessor I get that I do but for
people who are like using it like
properly for real projects blows my mind
how long it took me to like learn sass
indented flavor like how long those
habits took to break like ten minutes I
and there's even like there's a there's
built-in to sass if you're using the
command-line you can write a command
that will change automatically for you
all of your s CSS to SAS s you can also
convert you can convert pages of s or
even CSS regular old CSS to
as a SS you can use a tool it does it
for you you don't have to go and erase
all those curly brackets or those
semicolons all you should it should be a
punishment for you and like I'm just
kidding but I guess that's the point if
I haven't made myself clear I think I've
mentioned it like three or four videos
so far a bit I think s CSS is
ridiculously noobish and upsetting and
and si SS is definitely where the
priority should be placed for people who
want to be proficient and exceptional
when it comes to their Styles alright I
gotta stop talking about this subject
but nobody has responded to how I feel
about sass versus less I'd like to have
I'd like to have a conversation with
anybody who's a proponent of scss this
is an open invitation if you like the
bracketed flavor better and would you
like to have a google hangout live and
we can stream it to YouTube and we can
just amicably discuss the the pros and
cons and and why you why you've just
decided that you like that better
and if you yourself don't want to have
the discussion but you know somebody
who's totally up into their bracketed
flavors have them have them contact me
you know have blood shoot me a note or
leave a comment anyway that'll wrap up
this video this is going to be a short
one book ten minutes I it's it's now
2:30 and I'm gonna you know the kids are
going to come in here like what the one
the one your old camp
is trapped inside of a cage well it's a
trip but it's basically the bed cage
right the other one just come in here
tap me on the face at like 7:00 or
morning and should be like dad dad why
are you sleeping I have to answer I can
see my body in a trance this is I feel
like crap I'm having so much fun such a
great conversation what do you guys want
to learn next leave a your note in the
comment below if you want to engage in
this conversation about indented verses
bracketed please let me know because I
like I honestly don't see it I don't see
what ever you like like I will admit
that bracketed is the most popular
version I don't understand why and um I
would like I would like it explained to
me anyhow I love you guys I love you so
much and I think you're fantastic you
are special and unique snowflakes and
you guys all deserve the very best that
you can get leave a comment below if you
have any questions or you'd like me to
talk about something or if you disagree
with something I've said in the past six
videos and if you watched if you like
really if you've watched these videos
all of them you deserve a medal you
deserve a trophy like like or at least a
bag of Cheetos send me a message and I
will announce your name definitely on
the channel and congratulate you and
thank you for suffering through like the
two hours of content just to learn a few
tricks and coding and hear stories about
one night and is this Michael nah I got
freaked out do you guys like this format
I know it I know the what videos are
much longer but I feel like it's a it's
fun it's it's fun or it's luck it's a
lot less stressful for me cuz I have to
write it and get out of repair
but then again the lessons are a lot
less organized there's like a lot of
pros for me a lot of cons for you as a
viewer yeah but it not every video has
to be like this but I do like they go
they'll do more of these but not so many
in one night just like you know once a
week pull out the camera but all right
love you guys I really really really
really appreciate it
like even if even if you're just
watching you're not going to subscribe
you're not going to comment or or engage
with the community your family
I really appreciate just that you're
listening and paying attention and I
hope look at my socks sounds a Dax fly
moment I hope that this stuff is you
know worth it to you please subscribe
comment click on other things if there's
if I feel like putting some stuff here
